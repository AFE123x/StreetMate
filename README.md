# StreetMate
## Inspiration
The motivation of the project was the struggles I faced when parking. Back in High School, my commute was 45 minutes and bus service wasn't provided in my area. Unfortunately, the school waitlisted my parking permit request, causing me to look elsewhere, and pay a hefty price, just to attend school. The same frustrations exist at college, where the school charges a ludicrous amount for permits, and fails to provide enough parking. It's also a community hazard, as people take measures like parking in the fire lane, which could take a life. 
## What it does
This project allows the client to list their own parking spot to rent out. Essentially the AirBNB for Parking. The goal is to make cities and busy areas safer and accessible for everyone. 
## How I built it
We used HTML, CSS and JS. 
## Challenges I ran into
- Finding means to store the listings. 
- Implementing a distance filter. 
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
- Implementing the distance filter, which involved the Haversine formula.
- Gaining an understanding of APIs
- Clean, well documented code. 
## What I learned
- Applying good software practices.
- Good version control. 
## What's next for StreetMate
- Implement a proper database to store listings
- Hosting it on a better server than github pages.
- building up the scale.
